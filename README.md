# packet-tracer-presence
A small script made with chatgpt to show off using Cisco Packet Tracer on Discord

## .exe version (recomended)
Put DiscordPrencense.exe where PacketTracer.exe is located, just launch DiscordPrencense.exe, it will start the script and launch packet tracer, its better to make a shortcut.

## Python version
To use it, download the [release](https://github.com/Coll147/packet-tracer-presence/releases/latest/download/release.zip) and extract the files where the Packet Tracer .exe file is located.
In my case, it's C:\Program Files\Cisco Packet Tracer 8.2.2\bin

Files:
DiscordPrecense.py --> manages presence in Discord

Currently, there's only a Windows version.
You need [Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.2/python-3.13.2-amd64.exe) and the dependences (pip install -r requirements.txt).
