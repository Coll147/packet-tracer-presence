# packet-tracer-presence
A small script made with chatgpt to show off using Cisco Packet Tracer on Discord

To use it, download the [release](https://github.com/Coll147/packet-tracer-presence/releases/latest/download/release.zip) and extract the files where the Packet Tracer .exe file is located.
In my case, it's C:\Program Files\Cisco Packet Tracer 8.2.2\bin

Files:
discord-rp.py --> manages presence in Discord
start.bat --> a simple script that runs Packet Tracer and the .py script

Currently, there's only a Windows version.
You need [Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.2/python-3.13.2-amd64.exe) and the dependences (pip install -r requirements.txt).
